### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is where the Android mobile project template used by **JumpStart** is stored.

### How do I get set up? ###

##### Summary of set up #####
####The following are the configurations already handled within the project:####
* Installation of dependencies needed for:
    * HockeyApp
    * ApiClient
    * JSONModel
    * Push Notifications setup
    * Project Directory and File Directory structure already prepared
    * Fastlane
* Constants and Util files
* Push Notifications setup
* Project Directory and File Directory structure already prepared
* Fastlane

##### Update project template #####
After cloning this template, you need to update the Package Name to conform to your project specifications. Also, add your preferred prefix to the Project settings so that files created afterwards will be distinct based on the prefix of choice.

####There are two steps to update the Package name:####
* First Changing the directory package:
    * First, go to the project directory in android studio then change the view to "Project"
    * then, click on the **settings(the cog wheel symbol)** then uncheck the `Compact Empty Middle Packages`. you can refer to this image https://image.prntscr.com/image/3ADQQa-MTCi8XsLfgdzOTA.png
    * after that you can now see the package name or directory of the app then you can rename it by folder using `Shift + F6`or `rightclick then click refractor, under refractor click rename`.
    * then choose rename package name. you can refer https://image.prntscr.com/image/McoQPu3cR5OvNNDNwLpHOA.png
* Second open the build.gradle of the project:
    * in the file there are code blocks, under **android > defaultConfig** there's a field `applicationId` change the package name under that field.
